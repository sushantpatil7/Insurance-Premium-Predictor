# Insurance-Premium-Predictor
The Insurance Premium Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the estimated insurance cost (premium) a customer would have to pay based on their personal details like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. It uses regression models to find patterns in the data and generate accurate premium predictions.
